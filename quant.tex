\section{The interpretation of pronouns}
We will consider how to recreate a simple interpretation of pronouns
ranging over individuals, first treating them in a similar way to free
variables in logic and then showing how they can be bound by
quantifiers.  The central idea is to use records as \textit{pronominal
  contexts} which correspond to partial assignments to variables in
logical treatments.  Consider first a simple sentence with a deictic
pronoun as in \nexteg{}.
\begin{ex} 
he left 
\end{ex} 
In our initial pass we will ignore matters
of gender to make things simpler.  The content of \preveg{} is a type
which depends on a context (a situation) which provides a value of the
pronoun \textit{he}. Thus it will have a parametric content which is a
function from a context assigning a value to the pronoun to a
type.\footnote{We will consider later how to combine types of context
  which assign values to pronouns with other context types which we
  have introduced with parametric contents.}  We will use the variable
`$\sigma$' to represent such contexts.  Thus a parametric content for
\textit{he} could be that given in \nexteg{a}, for \textit{left}
(ignoring tense) as \nexteg{b} and their combination, using a variant
of S-combination which we will discuss as we progress, is represented
in \nexteg{c}.
\begin{ex} 
\begin{subex} 
 
\item $\lambda\sigma$:\smallrecord{\smalltfield{x$_0$}{\textit{Ind}}} . 
        $\lambda P$:\textit{Ppty} . $P$(\smallrecord{\field{x}{$\sigma$.x$_0$}})
 
\item $\lambda\sigma$:\textit{Rec} . 
        $\lambda r$:\smallrecord{\smalltfield{x}{\textit{Ind}}} . 
              \record{\tfield{e}{leave($r$.x)}}

\item $\lambda\sigma$:\smallrecord{\smalltfield{x$_0$}{\textit{Ind}}}
  . 
         \record{\tfield{e}{leave($\sigma$.x$_0$)}}
 
\end{subex} 
   
\end{ex}
We follow Montague's strategy in allowing the content of \textit{he}
to be 
\begin{quote}
$\lambda\sigma$:\smallrecord{\smalltfield{x$_i$}{\textit{Ind}}} . 
        $\lambda P$:\textit{Ppty}
        . $P$(\smallrecord{\field{x}{$\sigma$.x$_i$}})
\end{quote} 
for any natural number $i$.  Thus considering the boy and the dog, a
content for \nexteg{a} will be \nexteg{b}.
